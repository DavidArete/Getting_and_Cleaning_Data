#Getting and Cleaning Data#
##Course Project Readme File#

This repository is for code written, and an output file, for the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

Repo contents
* **Readme.MD** - this file
* **run_analysis.R** - script file containing the code
* **Codebook.md** - file containing the descriptions of the data in the tidy data file.
* **Tidy_final.txt** - the final file generated from the script.


To use this files:
1. Unzip this file: **getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip**. It can be downloaded from *https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip* 
2. Set the unzip location and getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset\UCI HAR Dataset as your working directory (alternatively you can copy the contents of this folderr to your working directory.
3. Copy the run_analysis.R to your working directory.
4. Run run_analysis.R.
5. This should create two files. One big one containing lots of tidy data, called **tidy_Step1.txt**, and a second one called **Tidy_final.txt**, which should be a complete match of the file I uploaded to this repo.

How the script works is in the code comments.
